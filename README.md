<h1>Discord Bots</h1>


<h2>Tester Bot</h2>

<p>This bot contains the all the general code used in the bots that I use. This includes code that I created myself that may not be readily available anywhere else.
In exchange for that, the bot also has quirks at times and it may also not have the complete finished code. For finished code that may be more optimized or work better, 
please see the bots that are designed for that reason.

<h2>About</h2>
<br>
<p>This is version 1.0. Working on updating this bot soon, as well as adding the other bots that I have created for my discord channel.</p>

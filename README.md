<h1>Discord Bots</h1>


<h2>Tester Bot</h2>

<p>This bot contains the all the general code used in the bots that I use. This includes code that I created myself that may not be readily available anywhere else.
In exchange for that, the bot also has quirks at times and it may also not have the complete finished code. For finished code that may be more optimized or work better, 
please see the bots that are designed for that reason.

<h2>Raid Count Bot</h2>
<p>This bot helps keep track of the current participants at a raid or designated location. The way that this is achieved is by running the commands that will be added to this
readme file at a later date. The users can keep track of other users that are showing up for a raid. This will also help other users who are on a time crunch, and those who
want to know which raids have enough people to run</p>
<h2>About</h2>
<br>
<p>This is version 1.0. Working on updating this bot soon, as well as adding the other bots that I have created for my discord channel.</p>
